# Study Planner and Learning Partner.

A personalized, college-specific study planner that uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to help students organize their study schedule and get answers from their study materials, ALso helps teachers plan what to teach based on content material sourced from KTU Notes.

## Project Architecture

![Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ec952e5-c44b-4029-9d39-c16fe22fcf4b)

## Team Members

Arjun Jayakumar (Team Lead- Backend and LLM's)
Aditya S Nair (Frontend)
Abhiram Krishna (UI and Presentation)
Rajkamal SP (UI,UX Design)

## Features

- A vector database consisting of prexisting notes fetched from KTU Notes.
- Track study progress by chapter
- Generate adaptive study schedules based on:
  - Learning pace
  - Content complexity
  - Test deadline
- Query study materials for relevant information, Also test your skills by solving previous year Question papers.
- Visual progress tracking

## Setup and Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Start the backend server:
```bash
python start.py
```

The backend will run on http://localhost:8000

### Frontend Setup (in a separate terminal)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000

## Using the Application

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Upload study materials (PDFs) using the file upload button (In the future this wont be neccessary as we will store the vecotirized data in the PDF to a DB)
4. Ask queries regarding the subject material and also ask questions regarding study planning
5. Track your progress by marking chapters as complete and logging study time

## Technology Stack

- Backend Technologies:
   Python 3.8+ as the core programming language
   FastAPI for the web framework
   Pydantic for data validation
   Uvicorn as the ASGI server
   PyMuPDF (fitz) for PDF processing
   Sentence-Transformers for text embeddings
   FAISS for vector similarity search
   Transformers from Hugging Face for NLP models
   PyTorch as the deep learning framework
   Accelerate & BitsAndBytes for model optimization

- Frontend Technologies:

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement full RAG system with:
   - FAISS for efficient vector similarity search (Current implementation doesnt store the chunked PDF to a Database, In the future we will chunk and vectorize all the study materials sourced from KTU Notes and store them in the DB)
   - LLM's with higher paramters for better results.

2. User authentication and persistent storage
3. Advanced scheduling algorithms
4. PDF annotation and note-taking features
