# 🚀 Hackathon Submission Template using GitHub Actions

This repository provides an **automated workflow** to manage **hackathon project submissions** using **GitHub Issues & Pull Requests**.

## 📌 Features

- **Issue-Based Submissions** – Participants submit their projects via **GitHub Issues**  
- **Automatic PR Creation & Updates** – Converts issues into PRs and updates them if edited  
- **Submission Validation** – Ensures required fields exist in `submissions.json`  
- **Deadline Handling** – Marks late PRs with `[LATE]` and adds appropriate labels  
- **Automatic Merging** – PRs are merged when their associated issue is marked **completed**  
- **Clone Submitted Repositories** – Saves all valid submissions inside the repository

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Submitting a Project

1. Participants create a **GitHub Issue** using a predefined template.
2. If the issue is labeled **`project-submission`**, a PR is automatically generated.
3. The PR contains submission details and links to the participant's GitHub repository.

### 2️⃣ Validating & Reviewing

- PRs are checked for **missing fields** in `submissions.json`
- PRs **submitted late** are marked with `[LATE]` in the title
- Reviewers can approve and merge valid submissions

### 3️⃣ Automatic PR Merging

- If an issue is **marked as completed**, its associated PR is automatically merged.
- The project is then added to `submissions.json` in the repository.

### 4️⃣ Cloning Repositories

- Once a submission is merged, the workflow **clones the participant's GitHub repository** into the **`Submissions/`** folder.
